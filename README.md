## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS Transform Property, Translate Function
- CSS Variables
- CSS Imports

### What I learned

While working on this project, I once agained recalled how to center a div- vertically & horizontally. I revised the concept of imports in CSS and also got to test my skills at identifying the numbers of pixels used for padding via an image of the desired outcome.

```css
.qr-code-outer-div {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 15px;
  padding: 13px;
  position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  text-align: center;
  width: 300px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to further develop my understading of the transform property.
